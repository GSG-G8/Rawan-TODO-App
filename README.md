# Rawan-Todo-App
Todo App Project 

## Why I build this project?

I build this project to help the people who want to manage their time and they want to achieve their goals easily. So with this app they can track their progress and they can be more manageable.

 ## What is my project contain?

My project contain:

* The first section is the landing page, which contains an attractive quote to motivate the client to achieve his/her goals

* The client can add todo as he want.

* Also he can view all the todo to see what he/she is suppose to do.

* Aslo he can mark the done todo, to see his track.


## How the process of building our project done?

* I start by sketching the app and see what I am suppose to add to it.

* Then I divid the tasks, and I started working on it.

* After that I collected all of the work together.

## User stories:
As a disorganised person I want to:

* Enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
* View the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
* Mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
* The to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb


## Potential stretch goals
As a disorganised person I want to:

* Edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
* Click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
* A visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing
